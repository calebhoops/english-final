        <h4>About</h4>
        
        <p>The party was started in Oakland in 1966 by Huey P. Newton. The main purpose for starting the party
        was to challenge and supress police brutality. Social programs to help the public were also a major focus. The most well known programs
        were the Free breakfast for children and Community health clinics. The party is famous for its exercise of the 2nd amendment, the right to 
        bear arms. Members often open carry rifles and shotguns.</p>
